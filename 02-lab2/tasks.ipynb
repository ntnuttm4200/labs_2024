    "# Milestone 1 -- Web Server\n",
    "\n",
    "In this milestone, you will setup a web server using Nginx. \n",
    "[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) is a lightweight, open source web server that is widely used in production environments. \n",
    "In addition to serving web content, Nginx can also be used as a reverse proxy (a server that forwards requests to another server), a load balancer (a server that distributes requests to multiple servers), and an HTTP cache (a server that caches web content). \n",
    "In this milestone, you will use Nginx to serve web content for your own website. \n",
    "In the next milestone, you will use Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward requests to the email server (i.e., the web server will act as a front-end for the email server) to serve webmail content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides a brief introduction to Nginx, but you are encouraged to read the [Nginx documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) to learn more about Nginx. \n",
    "In particular, you should read the [Beginner's Guide](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nginx workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Nginx works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nginx listens on a specific port for incoming HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a request is received, Nginx looks for a configuration file that matches the request. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If a configuration file is found, Nginx will use the configuration file to process the request. \n",
    "The configuration file can specify the location of the web content. \n",
    "After processing the request, Nginx will return the response to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nginx configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuration file structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Nginx configuration files are located in the \"/etc/nginx/\" directory and are organized in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main configuration file is located in \"/etc/nginx/nginx.conf\". \n",
    "This file contains the global directives that define the behaviour of the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The configuration files for each site are located in the \"/etc/nginx/sites-available\" directory. \n",
    "These files contain the directives that define the behavior of the server when handling HTTP requests for a specific domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A symbolic link to the configuration file for each site is located in the \"/etc/nginx/sites-enabled\" directory. \n",
    "These symbolic links are used to enable or disable the sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuration syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize the behaviour of Nginx by defining directives in the configuration files. \n",
    "Directives are divided into two categories: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple directive: consists of the name and parameters of the directive. \n",
    "For example, the `listen 80;` directive tells Nginx to listen on port 80 for incoming HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Block directive: consists of the name of the directive followed by braces that contain other directives. \n",
    "The two important block directives are `server { ... }` and `location { ... }`. \n",
    "    - The `server { ... }` directive contains multiple directives that define the behaviour of the server when handling HTTP requests for a specific domain. \n",
    "    - The `location { ... }` directive tells Nginx where to find the web content for a specific location.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1.1 -- Setup your own website\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will use Nginx to serve your own website. \n",
    "Nginx is already installed in the \"webserver\" container. \n",
    "Follow the steps below to setup your own website:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connect to the \"webserver\" container using `ssh`.\n",

    "It is responsible for sending email messages to the recipients or to different email servers. \n",
    "It also receives email messages from the senders or from different email servers. \n",

    "- **Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)**: \n",
    "The MDA is responsible for retrieving the email messages from an MTA and storing them in the mailboxes of the recipients. \n",
    "IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) or POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3) are such protocols  used by the MDA to retrieve email messages from the MTA. \n",
    "In this lab, you will use the [Dovecot](https://doc.dovecot.org/), an open-source MDA. \n",
    "Dovecot is already installed and configured on the \"mailserver\" container.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mail Client**: \n",
    "The mail client is a software application that is used by the users to read and send email messages. \n",
    "In this lab, you will use the [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/), an open-source mail client. \n",

    "MySQL is already installed and configured on the \"mailserver\" container.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web Server**: \n",
    "The web server is used to host the webmail and the web-based administration interface. \n",
    "One such web-based administration interface is [Postfixadmin](https://github.com/postfixadmin/postfixadmin), which you will use to manage the mailboxes and the virtual domains. \n",
    "Another such web-based administration interface is [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/), which you will use to manage the MySQL database.\n",

    "# Milestone 3 -- DNS\n",
    "\n",
    "In this milestone, you will configure your own DNS server and use it to resolve domain names. You will also capture  and analyze DNS traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use the software package [BIND9](https://www.isc.org/bind/) to set up your own DNS server. \n",
    "BIND9 is a free and open-source implementation of the DNS protocols and it is [widely used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND) especially in Unix-like operating systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "A simplified workflow of BIND9 is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The DNS server is configured with a set of DNS records that map domain names to IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The DNS server listens for DNS queries from clients on a specific port (usually 53).\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a client sends a DNS query to the DNS server, the server looks up the domain name in its records and returns the corresponding IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the DNS server does not have a record for the domain name, it forwards the query to another DNS server. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration files\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration files for BIND9 are located in the `/etc/bind` directory. \n",
    "These are the main files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `named.conf`: The primary configuration file that `includes` other configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `named.conf.options`: The configuration file that specifies the options for the DNS server. \n",
    "Here you can specify the port number that the DNS server listens on, which networks are allowed to query the server, which DNS servers to forward queries to, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `named.conf.local`: The configuration file that specifies the \"zone\" files that the DNS server uses. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Zone files](https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapter3.html#base-zone-file)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A zone file contains a list of DNS records that the DNS server uses to resolve domain names. \n",
    "There is a zone file for each domain name that the DNS server is responsible for. \n",
    "For example, if the DNS server is responsible for the domain name `team30.com`, there will be a zone file called `team30.com.zone` in the `/etc/bind` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Zone file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_file)\n",
    "\n",
    "A zone file contains a list of entries, separated by newlines. \n",
    "Each entry can be a directive or a record. An entry consists of several fields, separated by whitespace (tabs or spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common directives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `$ORIGIN`: Specifies the domain name that the records in the zone file are relative to. \n",
    "For example, if the zone file is `team30.com.zone`, the `$ORIGIN` directive should be `team30.com`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `$TTL`: Specifies the default time-to-live (TTL) for the records in the zone file. \n",
    "The TTL specifies how long a client should cache the record before querying the DNS server again. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
