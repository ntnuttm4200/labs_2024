To find this flag you have to figure out which flag is the real one. 
We have created an md5-hashsum of the correct flag, which means you have to repeat
the process to be able to verify the flag. To do this you must find the
md5sum of the text inside the flag.txt-files.
The correct md5sum is: 628517d405b8962385ffdb91953f40cc 

Hint: Use cat, echo,  pipelining '|' and the command md5sum
